Problem Statement

Let's start simple. Can you complete the function solveMeFirst to return the sum of the two integers passed as input parameters? You can pick your favorite programming language.

Problem Statement

You saw a sample challenge in Solve Me First.

Here we give you a full challenge with all of the components that you typically see on HackerRank. In addition, we have provided a more complex I/O template in your preferred language. The given code includes scanning two space-separated integers from STDIN in a loop over T lines, calling a function, returning a value, and printing that value to STDOUT.

Pseudo code:

read T
loop from 1 to T
    read A and B
    compute the sum
    print value in a newline
end loop

The code has already been provided for most of the popular languages. This is primarily for you to read and inspect how the I/O is handled.

Input Format

The first line contains T (number of test cases) followed by T lines. Each line contains A and B integers, separated by a space.

Output Format

An integer representing the sum for every test case on a new line.

Constraints 
1≤T,A,B≤1000
Sample Input

2
2 3
3 7
Sample Output

5
10
Explanation

The 2 in the first line describes how many test cases will follow, and the test case integers are 2, 3 and 3, 7 featured on two separate lines. Your output should be the sum of those test cases: 5 and 10 printed on two separate lines. If you print extra lines or any extra characters in your output, your answer will not get accepted because the judging is done using a diff checker.
